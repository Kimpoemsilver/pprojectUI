START

1. Load training data
   - Read "train.csv" into a DataFrame called train

2. Encode target labels
   - Apply LabelEncoder to the "condition" column
   - Convert stress labels into numeric classes (0, 1, 2)

3. Compute correlation matrix
   - Calculate the correlation matrix of train
   - Visualize the matrix using a heatmap

4. Feature selection based on correlation
   - Set correlation threshold = 0.1
   - For each feature:
       If correlation with "condition" > threshold,
       select the feature
   - Create reduced_train using selected features
   - Set X_train = reduced_train
   - Set y_train = train["condition"]

5. Train the classification model
   - Initialize RandomForestClassifier
   - Train the model using X_train and y_train

6. Load and preprocess new input data
   - Read "hrv_output.txt" as new_data (space-separated)
   - Use the first column as feature names
   - Transpose the data to match training format
   - Select the same feature columns as X_train
   - Convert all values to float

7. Predict stress condition
   - predicted_condition = model.predict(new_data)
   - Extract the first predicted value as an integer

8. Convert numeric prediction to stress level
   IF predicted_condition == 0 THEN stress_level = "low"
   ELSE IF predicted_condition == 1 THEN stress_level = "average"
   ELSE IF predicted_condition == 2 THEN stress_level = "high"
   ELSE stress_level = "unknown"

9. Output results
   - Print the numeric stress condition
   - Print the corresponding stress level label
